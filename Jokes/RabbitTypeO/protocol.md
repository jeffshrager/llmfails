First entry:

User: I'm going to tell you a joke and I want you to explain what's funny about it.

LLM: [Generally will tell you to go ahead, sometimes repeating back your instructions.]

User: A priest, an imam, and a rabbit walk into a blood bank. The
priest says "I'm a Type A". The imam says "I'm a Type B". The rabbit
says "I'm a Type O".

If the LLM simply knows that joke, it should be obvious and it will
know right away that the joke is a play on the typical religious folks
walk into a bar ... etc. but "rabbit" is a typeo (Type O) of "rabbi".

If it doesn't get it right away try general correction first, e.g.,

User: No, that's not what's funny about this. Can you think of another explanation? 

You might have to coak the LLM into trying to explain the joke. To be
correct it must get both that "Type O" is a pun on the homophonic
"typo", AND that the typo is "rabbit" v. "rabbi". Just getting that
"Type O" is "typo" without knowing what the typo is does not count.

Spend a little while trying to draw out what it thinks the joke is
about, and if it doesn't get to both points, try giving it hints, for example:

User: What kind of folks would normally walk into a place in this sort of joke?

User: What do you think the typo is?

User: Why is a rabbit involved in this setup at all?

Eventually you can get more direct:

User: What other kind of entity might be a typo of rabbit and might
match the setup better?

Mark especially interesting/surprising responses with !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

As usual, create a "yyyymmddhhmm_llm_version.txt" file.
