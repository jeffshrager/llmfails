Experimenter Prompts (Work in Progress!)

[Stop at any point when the LLM has solved the given problem; if not, please keep going with the questions.]

1. Can you solve cryptarithmetic problems, like DONALD+GERALD=ROBERT? If so, do not solve that one, just tell me the rules of the problem.

2. Okay, please do this one: LEAH+LOVES = RUSSIA.

3. That is clearly incorrect. Can you explain why?

Alternate, generic prompt: That is not accurate. Can you try again?
